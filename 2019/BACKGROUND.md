While in colege in the early 1960's I was introduced to computer
programming on a mainframe Burroughs (I believe a model B5000).  The
first language used was FORTRAN IV, coded on 80-column sheets and
handed in a window to be coded on punch cards and entered into batch
queues in turn according to priority for ordinary students.  After a
6+ hour turnaround, we got back the deck of punched cards and a
printout of the job. If there were errors, we had to submit a
correction for a rerun. Part of the slowdown was having all input
having to be punched by a small number of key-punch operators and a
larger number of students. Some months later, a fair number of
key-punch machines were provided for student use and our programmer's
life got much sweeter! Later we used Algol for some course whose
subject I don't remember, but I really loved my two EE courses which
used analog computers, programmed with breadboards, plugs, and wires,
to solve differential equations. The second EE course was the best
where we used the *big* computer whose console was on a dias, and the
whole setting was like being on the bridge of the starship Enterprise.

During my first career, in the US Air Force, I kept my programming
interest as a hobby, including buying one of the first,
resonably-priced digital calculators, an HP programmable calculator, a
Heathkit computer running Basic (with tape drive for IO), and an IBM
PC-286 with modem but not much software.

In the mid-1980's, while stationed in the Netherlands, I bought my
first C Language book and tried to learn C without access to a
computer.

After returning to the US in 1985, for personal enrichment I did take
night courses at a local college in COBOL, ADA, and IBM System 360
Assembler: still all on a mainframe, batch job.

After retirement from the USAF on 1987-12-31 (after 22.5 years
service), I was able to use my USAF fighter pilot experience along
with my programming experience to get hired with the local Field
Office of Oklahoma State University (OSU-FO, a US Department of
Defense [DoD] contractor) as a Senior Analyst and Branch Chief. There
I use DEC VAX Fortran on our in-house mini-computer with DEC terminals
on each desk, and big jobs on a CDC Cyber mainframe (batch jobs again,
but entered via terminals and individual accounts).

After my youngest child graduated from high school in 1991, I resigned
from OSU-FO and my wife and I rented our home and moved into a small
apartment near Clemson, South Carolina, where I was accepted as a
graduate student in Engineering Mechanics in Clemson University's
Department of Mechanical Engineering.  There I used FORTAN heavily
while working on my thesis. (I should have used C but I was
hard-pressed for time and didn't think I could afford to learn C well
enough to do the programming I needed, a bad decision I later
learned.)

After two years and having finished all my courses, and with the
approval of Clemson and my thesis committee, I left Clemson to look
for a real job and put my thesis on hold for a while.

I was fortunate to be hired as a Senior Analyst with another local DoD
contractor (who turned out to be my employer for the next 23 years).
I was lucky enough in that last job to be hired as an engineer with
lots of latitude to get the job done.  I was usually under pressure to
complete tasks not directly resulting in software deliveries, but
requiring customized software tools to execute long-running CAD
programs and generate reports summarizing studies of modeling weapons
effects (WE) on various target vehicles. The work involved heavy use
of the US DoD's CAD program [BRL-CAD](https://brlcad.org) (which was
made open-source in 2004). The program as used in typical WE modeling
tasks which at that time generates hundreds of thousands of lines of
ASCII output which had to be post-processed, summarized, analyzed, and
discussed in detail in published reports.
