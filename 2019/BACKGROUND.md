For personal enrichment in the late 1980's I did take, off-duty while
still in active service with the USAF, courses in COBOL, ADA, and IBM
System 360 Assembler: still all on a main-frame, batch job.

After retirement, I was able to get hired with the local Field Office
of Oklahoma State University as a Senior Analyst and Branch Chief (supervising two
people).  as a Senior Analyst hired to conduct
vulnerability studies of weapons effects against hardened and buried
bunkers,

But I was
lucky enough in my last career to be hired as an engineer with lots of
latitude to get the job done.  I was usually under pressure to
complete tasks not directly resulting in software deliveries, but
requiring customized software tools to execute long-running CAD
programs and generate reports summarizing studies of modeling weapons
effects (WE) on various target vehicles. The work involved heavy use
of the US Department of Defense's CAD program
[BRL-CAD](https://brl-cad.org) (which was made open-source in
2004). The program as used in typical WE modeling tasks generates
hundreds of thousands of lines of ASCII output which has to be
analyzed and summarized and discussed in detail in published reports.
