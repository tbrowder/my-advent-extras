# Raku Advent Extras

Repository for extra information for my Raku Advent articles.

Each year's article may have extra or surplus information that,
while interesting to the author (yours truly), probably shouldn't be 
in the body of the article but could be placed here and linked
into the article as a footnote or other addendum.

Likewise, long chunks of code can be placed here and linked into
the pertinent article.
